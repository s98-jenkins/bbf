<h3>Here goes your custom form</h3>
<p>Override HTML by creating a new partial called <strong>default.htm</strong> (more info <a href="https://octobercms.com/docs/cms/components#overriding-partials" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p>You can copy/paste this basic template:</p>
<form data-request="{{ emptyForm }}::onFormSubmit">
        {{ form_token() }}
        <div id="{{ emptyForm }}_forms_flash"></div>
        <!-- YOUR FORM FIELDS -->
        
        <!-- SUBMIT BUTTON -->
    </form>
